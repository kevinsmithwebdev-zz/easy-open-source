# Easy Open Source

This repo is intended to be the easiest possible open to contribute to. All the person must do is add their name to a text file. This way, the contributor does not have to worry about issues of code but can focus on the workflow of contributing to open source on github.

Please read our Code of Conduct and our Contributing information.
